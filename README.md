# Randomness

Randomness is a Python application designed to enhance your digital security. It leverages the true random number generator provided by random.org to create secure passwords or PINs.

## Features

- **Secure Password Generation**: Randomness can generate strong, secure passwords that are difficult to crack. These passwords are generated using true randomness, which makes them highly unpredictable and secure.

- **PIN Generation**: In addition to passwords, Randomness can also generate PINs. Whether you need a PIN for your phone, your bank account, or any other purpose, Randomness has you covered.

- **User-Friendly**: Randomness is designed to be easy to use. Simply choose whether you want a password or a PIN, and Randomness will do the rest.

# How to Obtain a random.org API Key

To use Randomness, youâ€™ll need a random.org API key. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to obtain one:

**Visit random.org**: Go to the random.org API Dashboard and sign up for a free developer key1.

**Register**: If you donâ€™t already have an account, youâ€™ll need to register. This process involves providing some basic information and verifying your email address.

**Get Your API Key**: Once youâ€™ve registered and logged in, you can create a new API key2. This key will be used to authenticate your requests to the random.org API.

Remember to keep your API key secure and do not share it with others. Now, youâ€™re ready to use Randomness!

# How to Use

Once you have your random.org API key, you can input it into the Randomness application - it will ask you for the API the first time you run the application and store it in the Registry - "Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Randomness" - if you've entered an
incorrect API, you can update it here.

Simply choose whether you want a password or a PIN, and Randomness will generate a secure password or PIN for you.

Please note that the randomness used in this application comes from atmospheric noise, which for many purposes is better than the pseudo-random number algorithms typically used in computer programs.
