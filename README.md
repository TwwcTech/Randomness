# Randomness

Randomness is a Python application designed to enhance your digital security. It leverages the true random number generator provided by random.org to create secure passwords or PINs.

## Features

- **Secure Password Generation**: Randomness can generate strong, secure passwords that are difficult to crack. These passwords are generated using true randomness, which makes them highly unpredictable and secure.

- **PIN Generation**: In addition to passwords, Randomness can also generate PINs. Whether you need a PIN for your phone, your bank account, or any other purpose, Randomness has you covered.

- **User-Friendly**: Randomness is designed to be easy to use. Simply choose whether you want a password or a PIN, and Randomness will do the rest.

## How to Use

Using Randomness is simple. After launching the application, you'll be presented with two options: generate a password or generate a PIN. Choose the option that suits your needs, and Randomness will generate a secure password or PIN for you.

Please note that the randomness used in this application comes from atmospheric noise, which for many purposes is better than the pseudo-random number algorithms typically used in computer programs.

We hope you find Randomness to be a valuable tool in your digital security toolkit. Please feel free to contribute to the Randomness project on GitHub and share any issues or suggestions you may have. Stay secure! ðŸ”’
